- 👋 Hi, I’m @nlsdbs (on Twitter too)
- 👀 I’m interested in web3. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the foundation in CSS and JS. Not particularly aiming to become a full-stack or a blockchain developper. I want to have skills to understand how smart contract works.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on blockchain-based project. I have a legal background and I hope to transition to web3. 
- 📫 How to reach me ysy.blockchain@gmail.com
